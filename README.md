## 📌 Project Overview

Our project aims to:

- Predict the **criticality level** (mild, moderate, severe) of organ conditions for:
  - **Lungs**
  - **Kidney**
  - **Heart**
  - **Liver**
- Provide **disease diagnosis support** using real-world medical datasets.
- Use **Machine Learning (ML)** and **Deep Learning (DL)** models for accurate predictions.
- Assist in treatment planning or transplantation prioritization based on risk analysis.
